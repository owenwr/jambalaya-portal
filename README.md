**Installation**
1. Install the Ruby version specific in .ruby-version (you might want to use rbenv to manage multiple ruby versions)
2. Install all required gems with $ bundle install
3. Install the yarn package manager. On OSX, this can be done with brew: $ brew install yarn --ignore-dependencies. The ignore dependencies optional argument stops brew from installing node.js.
4. Install the Javascript dependencies with $ yarn install
